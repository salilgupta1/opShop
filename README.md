OpShop is a EECS 338/Jour 340 project at Northwestern University that combines Medill Journalism students with McCormick Computer Science students to create a media based web application. OpShop's specific purpose to find opposing congressional opinions on relevant issues. 

Currently the project is in its development phase. 
Things to work on:

1) A more precise way to select congressmembers to look for quotes for based on article topic
2) Stronger keyword and quote extraction for more relevant information coming back to the user
3) Restructuring of databses to incorporate more dimensions about congressional members to help better identify potential congress members
4) Some sort of caching system to cache previously searched topics/articles
